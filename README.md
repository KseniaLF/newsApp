### **The Technical Assignment**

To build a small React component that displays a list of items
retrieved from an API endpoint. Each item should have a title and description, and the list should have a "Load More" button that retrieves more items and appends them to the list.

### Requirements:

- Use React.js and `TypeScript` for the implementation
- Use the `axios API` to retrieve the list of items from the provided endpoint
- Use `CSS` to style the component (you may use a CSS framework if you prefer or another approach like `styled-components`)
- Use `pagination` to limit the number of items shown initially (e.g., show 10 items at first and load more than 10 items when the "Load More" button is clicked)
- Handle error cases (e.g., when the API is down, or the response is malformed)
- Add unit tests for the component using `Jest` and `React Testing Library`
- Add `search functionality` to filter the list of items by title or description
- Use `React Router` to handle different routes and views
- Use `Redux Toolkit` or React Context API for state management
